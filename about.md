Hello, I'm Frédéric Klein.

I've been endorsed for my deep expertise in Cloud and DevOps, stemming from impactful roles at industry leaders like VMware Tanzu, Orange, and AWS. It's my privilege to have been part of teams where I could contribute to shaping the future of cloud solutions and directly impact user experiences. 

Beyond my corporate journey, I'm an entrepreneur at heart. I co-founded "Sarycom Technology", a platform that passionately promotes African cinema online. Our dedication is reflected in our thriving community of over 130,000 followers and a partnership with Canal+ Africa, which stands testament to the quality and reach of our work.

With a strong academic foundation Master 2 degrees from ESIEE-IT School, complemented by elite certifications like CKA and CKAD, I'm driven by the synergy of Cloud, MLOps, and DevOps. My vision is to harness these to craft groundbreaking AI solutions. My writings in MLOps have garnered widespread recognition, and I'm eager to channel these insights into crafting solutions that not only address but anticipate business challenges.

As I look ahead, I am excited about collaboratively discovering, designing, and deploying avant-garde AI solutions that cater to, and even predict, evolving business needs.

To delve deeper into my professional journey or to discuss potential collaborations, please explore my <a href="blog.fklein.me">blog</a>, or my Linkedin Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fklein82/"> Linkedin Profile</a> . I believe in the transformative power of technology and am eager to contribute to a future where AI seamlessly integrates with everyday business.
